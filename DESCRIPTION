  that let users get document content into data objects. A set of functions 
  lets add and remove images, tables and paragraphs of text in new or existing documents.

  slides can also be added or removed. When working with 'Word' documents, a cursor can be 
  used to help insert or delete content at a specific location in the document. The package
