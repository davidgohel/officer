The officer package lets R users manipulate Word (`.docx`) and 
PowerPoint (`*.pptx`) documents. In short, one can add images, 
tables and text into documents from R. An initial document can 
be provided; contents, styles and properties of the original 
document will then be available.

## Word documents

The `read_docx()` function will read an initial Word document (an 
empty one by default) and lets you modify its content later.

The package provides functions to add R outputs into a Word document:

* images: produce your plot in png or emf files and add them into the document, 
  as a whole paragraph or inside a paragraph.
* tables: add data.frames as tables, format is defined by the associated Word table style.
* text: add text as paragraphs or inside an existing paragraph, format is defined by the associated Word paragraph and text styles.
* field codes: add Word field codes inside paragraphs. Field codes is an old 
  feature of MS Word to create calculated elements such as tables of contents, 
  automatic numbering and hyperlinks.

File generation is performed with the `print` function.

### import Word document in a data.frame

The function `docx_summary()` reads and imports content of a Word 
document into a data.frame. The function handles paragraphs, 
tables and section breaks.


## PowerPoint documents


The function `read_pptx()` will read an initial PowerPoint document 
(an empty one by default) and let you modify its content later.

The package provides functions to add R outputs into existing or new PowerPoint slides:

* images: produce your plot in png or emf files and add them in a slide.
* tables: add data.frames as tables, format is defined by the associated PowerPoint table style.
* text: add text as paragraphs or inside an existing paragraph, format is defined in the corresponding layout of the slide.

In a PowerPoint document, one can set a slide as selected and reach a particular shape (and remove it or add text). 

File generation is performed with the `print()` function.

### import PowerPoint document in a data.frame

The `pptx_summary()` function reads and imports content of a PowerPoint 
document into a data.frame. The function handles paragraphs, tables and images.
