# add images into an rdocx object

reference images into a Word document. This function is now useless as
the processing of images is automated when using
[`print.rdocx()`](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/reference/print.rdocx.md).

## Usage

``` r
docx_reference_img(x, src)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  an rdocx object

- src:

  a vector of character containing image filenames.
