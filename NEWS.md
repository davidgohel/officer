# officer 0.6.8

## Issues

- Simplified input format for `location` arg in `ph_with_*` functions (#623). Instead of a `location` object 
  created by the `ph_location_*` function family, `ph_with_*` functions now resolves certain short form
  input into corresponding `location` objects. For example, instead of using `ph_location_label("<label>")`
  you can now simply pass the `"<label>"` to the `location` arg. The functionn will convert the string into
  the corresponding location object automatically. Other examples are `"body [1]"` for 
  `ph_location_type(type = "body", type_idx = 1)`, or the integer `1` for `ph_location_id(id = 1)`
- Add `slide_visible()` to get and set the visibility of slides (#622).
- debug selector for `ph_remove()` (see #625) that was not working for rvg outputs.
- `phs_with`: filling multiple placeholders on one or more slides at once using key-value pair syntax (#639).
- `add_slide`: new args `...` and `.dots`, both passed to `phs_with` to create slide and fill placeholders in one step (#639).
- add support for pdf in office extensions (#613).

## Internals

- remove old visual tests

# officer 0.6.7

## Issues

- store paddings as numeric values and not integer values.
- remove_fields in `docx_summary()` now also removes "w:fldData" nodes.
- complete the manual of `body_add_docx()` with a note about the file basename
that can not contain ' ' and trigger an error if it contains a ' '. 
- `plot_layout_properties()` gains a 'title' parameter, which will add the layout name as the plot title. Defaults to 
`FALSE`, to not alter the old behavior. Also, the slide width and height are now correctly displayed in the plot. 
Before, a box was drawn around the plot area. However, the plot area var with device size, not slide size.
- class `dir_collection`: Files are now added to a container in the order of their trailing numeric index (#596).
For example, `slideLayout2.xml` will now preceed `slideLayout10.xml`. Before, alphabetical sorting was used, where 
`slideLayout10.xml` comes before `slideLayout2.xml`.
- `layout_properties()` now returns all placeholders in case of multiple master (#597). Also, the internal `xfrmize()` 
now sorts the resulting data by placeholder position. This yields an intuitive order, with placeholders sorted from 
top to bottom and left to right.
- `ph_location_type()` now throws an error if the `id` for a `type` is out of range (#602) and a more 
informative error message if the type is not present in layout (#601).
- `plot_layout_properties()` assignment order fixed for `labels= FALSE` (#604)
- `layout_properties()` gains a `type_idx` column to index phs of the same type on a layout. Indexing is performed based on ph position, following a top-to-bottom, left-to-right order (#606).
- `plot_layout_properties()` plots more information by default now: layout name, ph label, ph id, ph type + index by default (#606).
- `ph_location_type()`: new `type_idx` arg replaces the deprecated `id` arg (#606).
- Add `ph_location_id()` as a new member to the `ph_location_*` family. It references a placeholder via its unique id (#606).
- `plot_layout_properties()`: Now accepts the layout index (see `layout_summary()`) as an alternative to the layout name.
  Gains an argument `legend` to add a legend to the plot. Also prints the current slide's layout by 
  default now, if not layout name is provided explicitly (#595).
  
## Features

- `layout_rename_ph_labels()` to rename ph labels (#610).
- add `layout_dedupe_ph_labels()` to handle duplicate placeholder labels (#589). 
By default, it will only detect duplicate labels, but apply no changes. With 
`action = "rename"`, it auto-renames duplicate labels and `action = "delete"` 
deletes duplicates, only keeping their first occurrence.
- new convenience functions `body_replace_gg_at_bkm()` and `body_replace_plot_at_bkm()`
to replace text content enclosed in a bookmark with a ggplot or a base plot.
- add `unit` (in, cm, mm) argument in function `page_size()`.

# officer 0.6.6

## Issues

- Fix. `docx_summary` preserves non-breaking hyphens. Non-breaking hyphens are 
replaced with a hyphen-minus (Unicode character 002D). Closes #573.
- `docx_summary()` gains parameter 'detailed' which allows to get a detailed 
summary including formatting properties of runs in a paragraph. Formatting 
properties are stored in a list column `run`, where each element 
is a dataframe with rows corresponding to a single 
run and columns containing the information on formatting properties.
- Fix. Add alt text to ggplot's added to a pptx with ph_with.gg. Closes #556.
- embedded image in PPT can now be associated with an hyperlink
- add a check to `block_pour_docx()` to avoid working with file paths 
containing '&'.

## Features

- `cursor_reach()` gains new argument `fixed` to enable exact matching.
It defaults to FALSE for backward compatibility.
- `remove_slide()` gains new argument `rm_images` to enable images deletion
from ppt/media.
- new function `body_comment()` adds a comment on an existing paragraph 
at the cursor position.
- `docx_summary()` gains parameter 'remove_field' to prevent field codes 
from appearing in the returned data.frame. 

# officer 0.6.5

## Features

with flextable (for Word and RTF).

## Issues

# officer 0.6.4

## Features 

- `fp_border()` gains support for all line border styles listed in ECMA-376 
  ยง 17.18.2 and allowed CSS border styles. Closes #165 and #443.

## Changes

- the dataframe returned by `docx_comments()` gains a list column `para_id` containing 
the id(s) of the parent paragraph(s). A possible breaking change is that the `commented_text` 
is now returned as a list column to account for comments spanning multiple runs.
The docs gain a description of the columns of the returned dataframe.
- `opts_current_table()` now ignore 'Quarto' setting.

## Issues

- Fix. Refactor `docx_comments()` to (properly) account for comments spanning 
multiple paragraphs, multiple comments in the same paragraph and replies. Closes #541.
- Check and stop if `fp_text_lite()` is using a *shading.color* but no *color*.
- Check used style in `body_add_caption()`.
- fix `ph_remove()`, `ph_slidelink()` and `ph_hyperlink()` that were not working since
the latest refactoring.
- Use fake attribute `stlname` if available in `docx_summary()`.
- calls to `file.copy(from = "template/*.xml")` are now done with argument 
`copy.mode = FALSE` for compatibility with 'nix'.

# officer 0.6.3

## Features

- new function `run_comment()` to create a run with a comment.
- new function `docx_comments()` to read comments in a Word document as a data.frame.
- Add pptx support for invalid pptx files downloaded from https://slides.new.

## Issues

- Internal function `is_doc_open()` replaces `is_office_doc_edited()` to check if a document is open on Windows. This solves the issue where RStudio crashed while trying to write to an open Office document.
- Add option `preserve` to preserve cell line breaks to `docx_summary()`.
- fix `ph_hyperlink()` when several hyperlinks are inside one slide and refactored `ph_remove()`.

# officer 0.6.2

## Issues

- force 'firstLineChars' to 0 so that Chinese users don't get 
unwanted first indentation.

when source is SVG in `external_img()`.

The previous behavior "don't trigger an error if a bookmark is missing" 
is back. 
- force Word default continuous section if no type is specified and first 
page footer/header if it is seen.
- drop "Compatibility Mode" from Word documents.

## Changes

- Change license to MIT.
- drop internal `get_at_cursor()`

## New features

* `set_doc_properties()` now supports any character property.
